# WordLadderShortestPath - Logic challenge 

Logic challenge to practice some good practices

## Line of thinking

The premise is get a list of word between two differents words, where change just one letter between each word of list.
To do this, I get first word and make a list of words with one letter different.
So, I make a list of lists with every path until find target word.

## Technical - Tools and pratices used
